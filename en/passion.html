    <h2>My passions</h2>
    <div class="musique">
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>With my sister playing the violin and my brother the flute, I was immersed in music from a young age. To fully dive into it, I decided to play the viola for about 8 to 9 years. The viola is similar to a violin but larger, producing a deeper sound.
            <br>I took part in several concerts at the conservatories of Dreux and Évreux in Normandy. I was part of a symphony orchestra at the Dreux conservatory and later joined a jazz group with my sister at the Évreux conservatory.
            <br>Playing music taught me discipline, perseverance, and creativity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bowling">
        <h3>Bowling</h3>
        <p>After stopping the viola, I wanted to find another passion to pursue. I came across a bowling club and immediately got hooked on the sport. I particularly enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and the slightly competitive side of the game. Playing with older people helped me improve my technique as well as my social skills. Through bowling, I gained patience, perseverance, and team spirit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="jeux_video">
        <h3>Video games</h3>
        <p>People can say a lot about video games, but they also teach many things:</p>
        <ul class="jeux-liste">
            <li>Hand-eye coordination</li>
            <li>Problem solving</li>
            <li>Teamwork</li>
            <li>Time management</li>
            <li>Creativity</li>
            <li>Perseverance</li>
            <li>Memory</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Anyway, we’re not here to debate that x).
            I play various games of all kinds. I spend a lot of time on Valorant or Phasmophobia, but I also play other games such as Minecraft (mostly vanilla survival), Borderlands (finished all except the 4th one — still need to finish it), Wolfenstein (also need to finish it), and It Takes Two (finished with my girlfriend).</p>
